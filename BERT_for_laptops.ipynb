    "# A BERT for laptops, from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple BERT lookalike that was developed for training on a laptop (with an Nvidia 3070 RTX GPU). The notebook is developed for educational purposes more than performance, but in a bit more than half a day of training you can get a model that (after further finetuning) obtains ~94% of the performance of the original BERT-base on the GLUE benchmark. The code here builds on work by Geiping & Goldstein [0], Izsak et al [1] and Karpathy [2] who have all made large language models (LLMs) more accessible for modest budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute this notebook from start to end to see the full process of setting up and training a tokenizer, pretraining a BERT model, and finetuning a BERT model on downstream NLP tasks. Most of the code from the notebook can also be found in this repository in regular Python files if you prefer, together with a few extra bits (e.g. [SpanBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10529) style sample generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The document is split into three sections:\n",
    "* _Data:_ This is where we obtain and preprocess the data for pretraining, and build and train the BPE tokenizer.\n",
    "* _Architecture:_ This is where we define our BERT.\n",
    "* _Training:_ First we pretrain the model on a \"masked language modeling\" (MLM) objective with a lot of data, then we finetune on a few smaller tasks from the GLUE benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run the full notebook on a full size model, expect training the tokenizer to take ~15 hours, pretraining with the MLM objective to take ~17 hours (on a 3070 RTX, adjust expectations for your own system), and finetuning to take about an hour. The notebook was tested with 32GB of regular RAM and 8GB of GPU memory, if you have less you might need to make some changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This BERT variant uses:\n",
    "* BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) tokenization.\n",
    "* Relative position embeddings.\n",
    "* Pre-layernorm.\n",
    "* No dropout.\n",

    "\n",
    "For a general description of BPE check out [this Hugging Face tutorial](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter6/5?fw=pt). At a high level, BPE is used to shorten the sequences we will feed into the language model in a meaningful way. Training the model on raw characters would be expensive - by using BPE we can represent common words by single unique tokens, and less common words by sequences of a few tokens, where each token hopefully carries some meaning of its own. We will briefly look at what the tokenizer does later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining the alphabet for our data, which is basically all printable ASCII characters and a few special tokens. The `[CLS]` token is fed as the first token of every sequence and may aid fine tuning. The `[MASK]` token is used during pre-training to indicate hidden tokens. The `[SEP]` token can be used to separate sequences in the input (this one becomes important during finetuning). The `[PAD]` token is used to make sure all input sequences consist of a fixed number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also differentiate between characters that are at the beginning of a word and characters that are in the middle. For example the token `\"_a\"` corresponds to an \"a\" starting a word, while `\"a\"` corresponds to an \"a\" inside the word."

    "Now that we have a BPE encoder, we need to learn the encoding from our data. This is what we collected the `word_counts` for earlier. We are only going to generate merge rules for alphabetic sequences: any tokens, numbers or symbols will be kept at the alphabet level.\n",

However, this algorithm could still be sped up significantly. That would add complexity and is beyond the scope of this project."

    "We have BERT, but we can't do anything with it yet: the top layer generates only hidden unit activations/embeddings. Depending on the training scenario, we will put a different \"head\" on BERT. During pre-training, BERT is learning masked language modeling (MLM), and it will take an MLM head that makes a token prediction for every position in the input. For our fine-tuning, BERT learns a single output for each input sentence (e.g. a true/false classification or some score), and we will use two different heads, one for classification and one for regression. These heads ignore most of the activations at BERT's top, and use only the activations for the very first token as input features during training."
